We are happy to announce that Version 2 of AWS Mobile SDK for Android is now in Developer Preview.  In Version 2 we have introduced new serviced designed for mobile, new mobile optimized connectors, and other feature improvements.  The highlights of Version 2 are as follows:

路         Amazon Cognito - is a simple user identity and synchronization service that helps you securely manage and synchronize app data for your users across their mobile devices.

路         Amazon Mobile Analytics - is a service for collecting, visualizing and understanding app usage data at scale that can process billions of events from millions of endpoints.

路         Amazon Kinesis Recorder - enables you to reliably record data to an Amazon Kinesis data stream from your mobile app.

路         Amazon S3 Transfer Manager - now supports aborting uploads, and pausing and resuming file uploads and downloads.
 

The new SDK is available in our [aws-sdk-android-v2](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-android-v2) repository.  You can also get the SDK from our [AWS Mobile SDK page](http://aws.amazon.com/sdkforandroid/).
